# pylarid: Load Arrays of Imaging Data

`pylarid` is a Python package that is intended to facilitate analysis of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

# Building Pylarid

`pylarid` consists of an extension module built in C++ to run on Python 3.
`pylarid` is currently tested using Python 3.12 on macOS Sonoma using Clang
and on Windows 11 using Visual Studio, and using Python 3.11 on Arch Linux
using GCC.

To build and install `pylarid` from source, [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a
compiler that supports C++20 are required.

## Build using PyPA's build (Recommended)

Preferably, this is done in a virtual environment. If using Visual Studio, use
a 64-bit native tools developer command prompt. First, install the most
up-to-date versions of `pip` and `pipx` in the virtual environment.

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pipx
```

Next, obtain the [pylarid](https://github.com/jme2041/pylarid.git) source code,
build, and install.

```
git clone git@github.com:jme2041/pylarid.git
cd pylarid
pipx run build --wheel -Cbuild-dir=build
pip install .
```

Note that `-Cbuild-dir=build` sets the temporary directory to `build`. This is
optional, but recommended for speeding up builds and for avoiding warnings
about the intermediate directory being temporary when building with Visual
Studio (warning MSB8029).

To run unit tests, use `pytest`:

```
pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```

To uninstall, use `pip uninstall pylarid`.

To create a source distribution, use `python -m build --sdist`.

## Manual Build Using CMake (advanced)

To build and install `pylarid` directly using CMake, create a `build` directory
within the `pylarid` directory and follow the normal steps for building and
installing software using CMake.

To build and install on macOS and Linux:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

To uninstall, use `make uninstall`.

To build and install on Windows using Visual Studio:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

To uninstall, use `cmake --build . --config Release --target uninstall`.
